    "## 1 CALCULATOR WITH LAMBDA FUNCTIONS (25 POINTS)\n",
    "### 1.1 Task\n",
    "Implement a function `calc(op, x, y)`, where `op` is a binary operation function. The function should return the result of `op(x, y)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, implement a helper function `get_op(op_name)`:  \n",

    "## 3 SIMPLIFIED MATCH-3 GAME (25 POINTS)\n",
    "You are developing a simplified match-3 puzzle game. The game is played on an \\(n ×m\\) grid where each cell contains a colored block represented by a capital letter. This assignment focuses on implementing basic 2D list operations and simple game mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Task\n",
    "Implement a simplified version of a match-3 game with the following rules:\n",
    "1. Game Board:\n",
    "• The game is played on an \\(n ×m\\) grid ( \\(3 ≤n\\) ,m≤10).\n",
    "• Each cell contains an uppercase letter (A-Z) representing a colored block.\n",
    "• The initial board will never contain any pre-existing matches.\n",
    "2. Game Commands:\n",
    "• swap x1 y1 x2 y2:\n",
    "– Swaps the blocks at positions \\((x 1, y 1)\\) and \\((x 2, y 2)\\) , where x stands for rows (the input n), and y stands for columns (the input m ).\n",
    "– Coordinates are 1-indexed (top-left corner is (1, 1)).\n",
    "• exit:\n",
    "– Ends the game immediately.\n",
    "– Outputs final score before terminating.\n",
    "3. Valid Moves:\n",
    "• Players can only swap two adjacent blocks (up/down/left/right).\n",
    "• Diagonal swaps are not allowed.\n",
    "4. Matching Rules:\n",
    "• A match occurs when exactly 3 identical blocks line up horizontally or vertically.\n",
    "• Special Rule: As a simplified match-3 game, the match only counts if the swap places a block in the middle position of the 3-in-a-row, i.e. the swapped block must become the center of 3 identical blocks.\n",
    "• Each valid match awards exactly 30 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Match Resolution:\n",
    "• All 3 matched blocks are removed from the board.\n",
    "• The empty spaces are filled with ’.’ characters.\n",
    "• No blocks will fall down to fill empty spaces.\n",
    "• No chain reactions occur after a match.\n",
    "6. Invalid Moves:\n",
    "• Any swap that doesn’t create a valid match (as defined above).\n",
    "– Attempting to swap non-adjacent blocks.\n",
    "– Trying to swap blocks outside the grid boundaries.\n",
    "• All invalid swaps will be automatically undone.\n",

    "3. Subsequent lines: Game commands:\n",
    "• swap x1 y1 x2 y2 to swap blocks at positions \\((x 1, y 1)\\) and \\((x 2, y 2)\\)\n",
    "• exit to end game.\n",

    "• After that, for each swap operation print:\n",
    "1. Current grid state ( n lines of m space-separated characters).\n",
    "2. Current score.\n",
    "• After “exit” command print: Final score.\n",

    "## 4 F1 RACE STRATEGY ANALYSIS (25 POINTS)\n",
    "### 4.1 Background\n",
    "You are an F1 race strategy engineer. During an intense race, you need to analyze telemetry data sent from your driver in real time to make the best strategy decisions such as determining pit-stop windows or evaluating tire performance. You will receive all lap time data of a driver in one race. Each lap contains three sector times (Sector 1, Sector 2, Sector 3) and the pit-stop time at the end of the lap. Your task is to process this raw data and respond to a series of strategy team queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Definitions\n",
    "#### 4.2.1 Lap Time\n",
    "The pure track time of a lap: \n",
    "\\[lap_time =S 1+S 2+S 3\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2.2 Total Time\n",
    "The total time from the end of the previous lap to the end of the current lap: \n",
    "\\[total_time =S 1+S 2+S 3+ pit_stop_time\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is no pit stop, pit stop time will be 0.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2.3 Sector Colors\n",
    "When processing the lap data in sequence, you should keep track of the personal best time (PB) for each of the three sectors (S1, S2, S3). A personal best means the fastest time the driver has achieved in that specific sector so far.\n",
    "For each new lap:\n",
    "• If the sector time is smaller (less) than the previous PB, mark this sector as Green. This means the driver has just set a new record for that sector.\n",
    "• If the sector time is bigger or equal to the previous PB, mark this sector as Yellow. This means the driver did not improve in that sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Format\n",
    "#### 4.3.1 Input\n",
    "An integer L represents total number of laps at first line. The next L lines: Each lap’s data in the format:\n",

    "• s1_time, s2_time, s3_time: floating numbers\n",

    "An integer N represents number of query commands at the next line. The following N lines: Each contains one query instruction (see below).\n",
